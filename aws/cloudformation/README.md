# Cloudformation

Cloudformation is an Infrastructure as Code (IAC) service from AWS that allows you to automate provisioning, updating, and destroying resources in an AWS environment. In Cloudformation, groups of resources are referred to as `stacks`. These stacks are defined inside of `Cloudformation Templates` that are defined in either `.yml` or `.json` files, with parameters passed in through `.json` files.
